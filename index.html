          The name
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowdonia">Snowdonia</a>
          derives from Snowdon, the highest mountain in the area and in Wales at
          3,560 ft (1,090 m). Before the boundaries of the national park were
          designated, Snowdonia was generally used to refer to a smaller area,
          namely the upland area of northern Gwynedd centred on the Snowdon
          massif, whereas the national park covers an area more than twice that
          size, extending far to the south into Meirionnydd.
